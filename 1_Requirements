Seat Heating Application:

The buttons have to be switched on before the app starts working. Potentiometer acts as temperature sensor.
It gives signal which is converted by ADC and used to make a PWM signal pf corresponding duty cycle, as seen in the oscilloscope.
As potentiometer is varied, message containing detected temperature is shown in serial monitor.

SWOT ANALYSIS
