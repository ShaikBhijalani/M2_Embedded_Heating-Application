Seat Heating Application:

The buttons have to be switched on before the app starts working. Potentiometer acts as temperature sensor.
It gives signal which is converted by ADC and used to make a PWM signal pf corresponding duty cycle, as seen in the oscilloscope.
As potentiometer is varied, message containing detected temperature is shown in serial monitor.

SWOT ANALYSIS:
   
STRENGTHS:

	1. User  friendly
	
	2. Easy to change temperature
	
	3. Low cost
	
	4. Can be installed easily
  
WEAKNESS:

        Applicable to cold countries.
    
OPPORTUNITIES:

        Can be used for other applications by changing the sensors.
     
Threats:

        Not suitable for high temperature  regions.
     
     
Challenges faced and How was it Overcome:

|No.|	Challenge|	Solution|
|----------|:-------------:|:------------|
|1.|	On the simulide on version where some requirements are not available|	Solved in the connect session|
|2.|	Issues in running the code|	Solved by exploring in futureskills platform|
|3.|	Issues in workflows on make file|	Solved by taking out my files from the implementation part and I kept them in separate files|
